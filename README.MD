# Growing islands to approximate tessellations of the plane by Voronoi diagrams

BSc Thesis "Data Science & Artificial Intelligence", 2023

_Voronoi diagrams are well-studied objects in the field of computational geometry. One problem related to Voronoi diagrams is the Inverse Voronoi Problem where, given a tessellation of convex regions, we wish to find the points which could have generated the tessellation. Sometimes this is not possible however, and we may not know if such a set of points can even be found, hence it is desirable to approximate the original tessellation by a Voronoi diagram. This research presents a new algorithm for generating these approximations using a proposed definition for ”Voronoi-ness” of arbitrary tessellations, previously not well-defined in the literature. Optimal parameters for the algorithm were deduced experimentally, and the results show that the algorithm does well on tessellations with mostly well-shaped and uniformly sized regions, as well as yielding a marginally better approximation for the territories of Tilapia mossambica than a previous paper._
